//Kth Smallest With Only 2, 3 As Factors
//Find the Kth smallest number s such that s = 2 ^ x * 3 ^ y, x >= 0 and y >= 0, x and y are all integers.
//
//Assumptions
//
//K >= 1
//Examples
//
//the smallest is 1
//the 2nd smallest is 2
//the 3rd smallest is 3
//the 5th smallest is 2 * 3 = 6
//the 6th smallest is 2 ^ 3 * 3 ^ 0 = 8
