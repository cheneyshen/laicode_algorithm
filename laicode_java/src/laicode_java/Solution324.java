//Different Elements In Two Sorted Arrays
//Given two sorted arrays a and b containing only integers, return two list of elements: the elements only in a but not in b, and the elements only in b but not in a.
//Do it in one pass.
//Assumptions:
//The two given arrays are not null.
//Examples:
//a = {1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5}
//b = {2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 6}
//The returned two lists are:
//[
//[1, 3, 5],
//[2, 4, 6]  // there are two 2s in a, so there is one 2 in b not in a
//]
