//Rainbow Sort III
//Given an array of balls with k different colors denoted by numbers 1- k, sort the balls.
//
//Examples
//
//k=1, {1} is sorted to {1}
//k=3, {1, 3, 2, 1, 2} is sorted to {1, 1, 2, 2, 3}
//k=5, {3, 1, 5, 5, 1, 4, 2} is sorted to {1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5}
//Assumptions
//
//The input array is not null.
//k is guaranteed to be >= 1.
//k << logn.
