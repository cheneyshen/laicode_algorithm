//Buy Stock IV
//Given an array of integers representing a stock¡¯s price on each day. On each day you can only make one operation: either buy or sell one unit of stock, and at any time you can only hold at most one unit of stock, and you can make at most K transactions in total. Determine the maximum profit you can make.
//
//Assumptions
//
//The give array is not null and is length of at least 2
//Examples
//
//{2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 2, 11}, K = 3, the maximum profit you can make is (3 - 2) + (5 - 1) + (11 - 2)= 14
