//3 Sum 3 Arrays
//Given three arrays, determine if a set can be made by picking one element from each array that sums to the given target number.
//
//Assumptions
//
//The three given arrays are not null and have length of at least 1
//Examples
//
//A = {1, 3, 5}, B = {8, 2}, C = {3}, target = 14, return true(pick 3 from A, pick 8 from B and pick 3 from C)
