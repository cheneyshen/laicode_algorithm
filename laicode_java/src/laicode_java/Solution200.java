//    Max Water Trapped II
//    Given a non-negative integer 2D array representing the heights of bars in a matrix. Suppose each bar has length and width of 1. Find the largest amount of water that can be trapped in the matrix. The water can flow into a neighboring bar if the neighboring bar's height is smaller than the water's height. Each bar has 4 neighboring bars to the left, right, up and down side.
//
//        Assumptions
//
//        The given matrix is not null and has size of M * N, where M > 0 and N > 0, all the values are non-negative integers in the matrix.
//        Examples
//
//    { { 2, 3, 4, 2 },
//
//        { 3, 1, 2, 3 },
//
//        { 4, 3, 5, 4 } }
//
//    the amount of water can be trapped is 3,
//
//    at position (1, 1) there is 2 units of water trapped,
//
//    at position (1, 2) there is 1 unit of water trapped.
