//Disjoint White Objects
//In a 2D black image there are some disjoint white objects with arbitrary shapes, find the number of disjoint white objects in an efficient way.
//
//By disjoint, it means there is no white pixels that can connect the two objects, there are four directions to move to a neighbor pixel (left, right, up, down).
//
//Black is represented by 1’s and white is represented by 0’s.
//
//Assumptions
//
//The given image is represented by a integer matrix and all the values in the matrix are 0 or 1
//The given matrix is not null
//Examples
//
//the given image is
//
//0  0  0  1
//1  0  1  1
//1  1  0  0
//0  1  0  0
//
//there are 3 disjoint white objects.
