//Largest Product Of Length
//Given a dictionary containing many words, find the largest product of two words’ lengths, such that the two words do not share any common characters.
//  
//  Assumptions
//  The words only contains characters of 'a' to 'z'
//  The dictionary is not null and does not contains null string, and has at least two strings
//  If there is no such pair of words, just return 0
//  Examples
//  dictionary = [“abcde”, “abcd”, “ade”, “xy”], the largest product is 5 * 2 = 10 (by choosing “abcde” and “xy”)
