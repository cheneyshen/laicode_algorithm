//Find Local Minimum
//Given an unsorted integer array, return any of the local minimum's index.
//An element at index i is defined as local minimum when it is smaller than all its possible two neighbors a[i - 1] and a[i + 1]
//
//(you can think a[-1] = -infinite, and a[a.length] = +infinite)
//
//Assumptions:
//
//The given array is not null or empty.
//There are no duplicate elements in the array.
