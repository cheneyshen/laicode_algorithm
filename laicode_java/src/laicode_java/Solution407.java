//Trim Binary Tree by Path Cost
//Given a binary tree, the path cost from the root node to each leaf node is defined to be the number of levels that the leaf is on.
//
//For example, in the following binary tree, the node 5 has its path cost to be 3, and node 8 has its path cost to be 4.
//
//                          1
//
//                      /       \
//
//                   2             3
//
//                /     \             \
//
//             4          5             6
//
//           /   \                      /
//
//         7      8                  9
//
//Given a binary tree, try to delete all the nodes that have no paths whose cost is >= k that go through it. In the above example, node 5 will be deleted.
