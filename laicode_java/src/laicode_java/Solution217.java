//Largest Set Of Points With Positive Slope
//Given an array of 2D coordinates of points (all the coordinates are integers), find the largest number of points that can form a set such that any pair of points in the set can form a line with positive slope. Return the size of such a maximal set.
//
//Assumptions
//The given array is not null
//Note: if there does not even exist 2 points can form a line with positive slope, should return 0.
//Examples
//<0, 0>, <1, 1>, <2, 3>, <3, 3>, the maximum set of points are {<0, 0>, <1, 1>, <2, 3>}, the size is 3.
