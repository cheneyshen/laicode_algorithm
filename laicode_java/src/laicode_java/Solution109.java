//    Reservoir Sampling
//    Consider an unlimited flow of data elements. How do you sample one element from this flow, such that at any point during the processing of the flow, you can return a random element from the n elements read so far.
//
//        You will implement two methods for a sampling class:
//
//            read(int value) - read one number from the flow
//            sample() - return at any time the sample, if n values have been read, the probability of returning any one of the n values is 1/n, return null(Java)/INT_MIN(C++) if there is no value read so far
//                You may need to add more fields for the class.
