//Place To Put The Chair II
//Given a gym with k pieces of equipment without any obstacles.  Let’s say we bought a chair and wanted to put this chair into the gym such that the sum of the shortest path cost from the chair to the k pieces of equipment is minimal. The gym is represented by a char matrix, ‘E’ denotes a cell with equipment, ' ' denotes a cell without equipment. The cost of moving from one cell to its neighbor(left, right, up, down) is 1. You can put chair on any cell in the gym.
//
//Assumptions
//
//There is at least one equipment in the gym
//The given gym is represented by a char matrix of size M * N, where M >= 1 and N >= 1, it is guaranteed to be not null
//​Examples
//{ { 'E', ' ', ' ' },
//  {  ' ', 'E',  ' ' },
//  {  ' ',  ' ', 'E' } }
//we should put the chair at (1, 1), so that the sum of cost from the chair to the two equipments is 2 + 0 + 2 = 4, which is minimal.
