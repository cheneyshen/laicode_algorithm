//Longest Bitonic Sequence
//Given an array with all integers,  a sub-sequence of it is called Bitonic if it is first sorted in an ascending order, then sorted in a descending order. How can you find the length of the longest bitonic subsequence.
//  
//  Assumptions:
//  The given array is not null.
//  Corner Cases:
//  A subsequence, sorted in increasing order is considered Bitonic with the decreasing part as empty. Similarly, decreasing order sequence is considered Bitonic with the increasing part as empty.
//  Examples:
//{1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 6, 1}, the longest bitonic sub sequence is {1, 3, 4, 6, 1}, length is 5.
