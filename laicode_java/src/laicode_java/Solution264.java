//Keep Distance For Identical Elements
//Given an integer k, arrange the sequence of integers [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, ...., k - 1, k - 1, k, k], such that the output integer array satisfy this condition:
//
//Between each two i's, they are exactly i integers (for example: between the two 1s, there is one number, between the two 2's there are two numbers).
//
//If there does not exist such sequence, return null.
//
//Assumptions:
//
//k is guaranteed to be > 0
//Examples:
//
//k = 3, The output = { 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3 }.
