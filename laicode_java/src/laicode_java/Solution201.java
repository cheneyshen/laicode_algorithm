//Largest Container
//Given an array of non-negative integers, each of them representing the height of a board perpendicular to the horizontal line, the distance between any two adjacent boards is 1. Consider selecting two boards such that together with the horizontal line they form a container. Find the volume of the largest such container.
//
//Assumptions
//The given array is not null and has size of at least 2
//Examples
//{ 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1 }, the largest container is formed by the two boards of height 2, the volume of the container is 2 * 4 = 8.
