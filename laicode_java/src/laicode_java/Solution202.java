//Kth Smallest In Two Sorted Arrays
//Given two sorted arrays of integers, find the Kth smallest number.
//
//Assumptions
//The two given arrays are not null and at least one of them is not empty
//K >= 1, K <= total lengths of the two sorted arrays
//Examples
//A = {1, 4, 6}, B = {2, 3}, the 3rd smallest number is 3.
//A = {1, 2, 3, 4}, B = {}, the 2nd smallest number is 2.
