//Kth Closest Point To <0,0,0>
//Given three arrays sorted in ascending order. Pull one number from each array to form a coordinate <x,y,z> in a 3D space. Find the coordinates of the points that is k-th closest to <0,0,0>.
//
//We are using euclidean distance here.
//
//Assumptions
//The three given arrays are not null or empty
//K >= 1 and K <= a.length * b.length * c.length
//Return
//a size 3 integer list, the first element should be from the first array, the second element should be from the second array and the third should be from the third array
//Examples
//
//A = {1, 3, 5}, B = {2, 4}, C = {3, 6}
//
//The closest is <1, 2, 3>, distance is sqrt(1 + 4 + 9)
//
//The 2nd closest is <3, 2, 3>, distance is sqrt(9 + 4 + 9)
