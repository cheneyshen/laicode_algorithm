//2 Sum 2 Arrays
//Given two arrays A and B, determine whether or not there exists a pair of elements, one drawn from each array, that sums to the given target number.
//
//Assumptions
//The two given arrays are not null and have length of at least 1
//Examples
//A = {3, 1, 5}, B = {2, 8}, target = 7, return true(pick 5 from A and pick 2 from B)
//A = {1, 3, 5}, B = {2, 8}, target = 6, return false
