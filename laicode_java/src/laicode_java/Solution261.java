//Sort In Specified Order
//Given two integer arrays A1 and A2, sort A1 in such a way that the relative order among the elements will be same as those are in A2.
//
//For the elements that are not in A2, append them in the right end of the A1 in an ascending order.
//
//Assumptions:
//
//A1 and A2 are both not null.
//There are no duplicate elements in A2.
//Examples:
//
//A1 = {2, 1, 2, 5, 7, 1, 9, 3}, A2 = {2, 1, 3}, A1 is sorted to {2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
